# heumeiles-docs

This repo is used to build the documentation for Ahoy-DTU and OpenDTU in a concise mkdocs format.

As most of the documentation for all MI-, HM- and HMS/HMT-series inverters are using the same protocol Gen3 / Gen2 DevInfo / DevCommand's the protocol and knowledge has a lot of overlap.
The HMS-WiFi-series instead use the NetworkCommand .protobuf commands which are described and documented in a separate chapter.
