This repository offers hardware and software solutions for communicating with Hoymiles inverters via radio. With our system, you can easily obtain real-time values such as power, current, and daily energy. Additionally, you can set parameters like the power limit of your inverter to achieve zero export. You can access these functionalities through our user-friendly web interface, MQTT, or JSON. Whether you're monitoring your solar panel system's performance or fine-tuning its settings, our solutions make it easy to achieve your goals.
